# TIME Series Forecasting
In this tutorial, the goal is to provide the steps and foundation for a good forecasting

## Convert the Data in time Series (ts)
* Convert in ts object
* convert in xts object
* Manipulate the periodicity of the XTS object
The periodicity is important after transforming the data in ts data, periodicity which is a function from xts library can be used to know the beginning of the data time and the end of the data time.
Window function can help subset the data from one period to a another period by determining the frequency. If the data is too large, to forecast it is sometime important to reduce the length of the data to more practical length of time.
